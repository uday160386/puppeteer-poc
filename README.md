My Opinion:

    Benefits of this library?
        This is a simple and easy to use library, for those applciation`s which runs on chrome browser.
        It is flexible to integrate with the jest/mocha framework.
        This framework helps to run the test scripts in headless mode, which are quite fast with test execution.
