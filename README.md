My Opinion:

    Benefits of this library?
        Simple and easy to use library, for those applciation`s which runs on desktop/mobile chrome browser.
        Support`s Firefox (still in experimental stage).
        Flexible to integrate with the jest/mocha framework.
        Can run the test scripts in headless mode, which are quite fast.
